## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - We incorporated a map feature using the Google Maps API.
 - We implemented user and service provider login.
 - Users can now view all service providers.
 - Service providers can add a food item to their menu.
 - We have a completed and styled landing page.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 - Splitting up work in a way that didn't result in us having to access the same files or components.
 - Splitting up work in a way that didn't require us to wait for one person to finish and thus holding the other person back.
 - Merging in Git. Had to resolve some conflicts

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 - We still need to allow users to click on services to view the service's menu.
 - We still need to allow users to click on a food item to view more details.
 - We will be prioritizing the above mentioned tasks along with css styling for already completed components.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- Yes, creating a Trello board and organizing tasks based on User Stories helped a lot. Also, wireframing with Figma helped a lot.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 - We currently don't have at rish features or user stories.
