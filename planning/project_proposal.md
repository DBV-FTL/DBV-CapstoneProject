How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Our project will stand out from these other websites because it connects the user to
restaurants, families, and cooks. As these other websites and apps only connects the user to
restaurants. 

Our project also provides a more specific array of ethnic food from individuals, families and restaurants rather than the option of cuisines from only restaurants
